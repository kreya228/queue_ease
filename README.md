# 🚀 Smart Queue Management System

A **Smart Queue Management System** is a full stack web application designed to digitize traditional queue systems used in places like hospitals, banks, government offices, and service centers.

The system allows users to **book service tokens online, track their queue position, and reduce waiting time**, while administrators can manage queues efficiently.

---

# 📌 Problem Statement

In many service organizations such as hospitals, banks, and government offices, people often need to wait in **long physical queues** to access services.

This creates several problems:

- ⏳ Long waiting times
- 👥 Overcrowded waiting areas
- ❓ Lack of transparency about queue position
- 📉 Inefficient service management

The **Smart Queue Management System** aims to solve these problems by providing a **digital platform for online token booking and queue tracking**.

---

# 💡 Proposed Solution

This system provides a **web-based queue management platform** where users can:

- Register and login
- Book service tokens online
- Track their queue position
- View estimated waiting time
- Cancel or manage tokens

Admins can monitor and manage the queue through a dashboard.
